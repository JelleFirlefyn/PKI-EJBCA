# How to setup EJBCA using ansible

Setting up EJBCA using ansible is a very simple task of executing one single playbook. First of all make sure ansible is properly installed and the host you want to run EJBCA on is listed in the ansible host file under ejbca. By running the command `ansible-playbook ejbca-setup.yml` ansible will make sure all neccesary requirements to install and run EJBCA using docker will be installed and EJBCA is set up. After the playbook has executed you will have to wait a few minutes before the EJBCA dashboard becomes available on this url: [https://ejbca-node1:443/ejbca/adminweb/](https://ejbca-node1:443/ejbca/adminweb/). The "ejbca-node1" part of the URL references to localhost, which means when you want to access the dashboard from a different device you will need to change this part to the actual IP or DNS of that device.
